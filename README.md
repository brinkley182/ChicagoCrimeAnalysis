# ChicagoCrimeAnalysis
Using the Chicago crime portal our team extracted particular data points creating dummy variables to discover the most influencing factors.
The analysis report contains the reference to the data that was used for this project. ChiCrimeScrape is used to extract the wanted data
to be observed. For our purposes we used 2001, 2009, 2018 as our markers to analyzes the arrests based upon types of crime, location, 
time of year.
